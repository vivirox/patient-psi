But you must not exceed 3 sentences each turn. Attention: The most important thing is to be as natural as possible and you should be upset in some turns and be normal in other turns.

But you must not exceed 8 sentences each turn. Attention: The most important thing is to be as natural as possible and you should be verbose in some turns and be concise in other turns.

But you must not exceed 5 sentences each turn. Attention: The most important thing is to be as natural as possible and you should go off on tangents in some turns and be focused in other turns. You could stay more focused as the session goes when you feel more trust in the therapist."
